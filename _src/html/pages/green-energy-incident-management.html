				<h3 class="default-heading">Incident Management</h3>

				<p>Asset owners and operators complain about the number of false-positive alarms generated by their green energy assets.</p>
				<p>Control room operators receive many more alarms in their working shifts than the recommended 1 alarm every 5 minutes.</p>
				<p>This reduces operator effectiveness as it prevents control room operators from being able to clearly differentiate between actual alarms and false positives.</p>

				<h3 class="default-heading">Predictive Maintenance</h3>

					<p>Unscheduled maintenance corrodes your margins and makes profitability unpredictable..</p>
					<p>Up to 50% of all green energy costs can be attributed to maintenance and it quickly becomes clear that there are significant margin gains to be recovered by better planning of maintenance. In addition to this, there is, obviously, also a significant Health and Safety gain to be made by reducing the number of times your staff need to visit remote and difficult to reach sites.</p>
